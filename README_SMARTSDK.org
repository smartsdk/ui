* Intro

This is a fork of rancher project to be used as the SmartkSDK platform
manager.

The software is running at: https://platform-manager.smartsdk.eu/.

You can login using your FIWARE Lab credentials:

* Development

The artifacts are build by a local CI/CD system using gitlab and
gitlab-ci.

Our branches are named after the upstream name by appending
=-smartsdk-dev=.

Our tags are named after the upstream name by appending =-smartsdk=.

For example staring from the upstream version: =v0.4.24= we may have a
branch named =v0.4.24-smartsdk-dev= and a tag named
=v0.4.24-smartsdk=.
